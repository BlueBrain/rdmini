# Very simple R-D system specification:
#
# * Base units are SI: metre, kilogram, second.
#   Concentration measured in count / m^3.
#   Reaction rates units by order:
#       order 0: m^-3 s^-1
#       order 1: s^-1
#       order 2: m^3 s^-1
#       order 3: m^6 s^-1
# * One geometry specification, currently only a box grid is supported.
# * One implicitly defined compartment, consisting of cells from the geometry.
